# TagVFS documentation

This project uses [Sphinx][1] for documentation.  You have to build the docs if
you don't want to read RST (but it's not hard).

To do this, you will first need the prerequisites as documented on Sphinx's
website.  Then, `cd` you r way into this directory, and run `make` for a help
menu.
